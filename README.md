## Totes McNotes

Check out the repo [here](https://github.com/parrottjrs/totes-mcnotes#hi-my-name-is-jordan-and-welcome-to-totes-mcnotes) or [dive straight into the app](parrottjrs.github.io/totes-mcnotes/) 

Totes McNotes is my main project for the first module of my course, and my first _real_ stab at using HTML, CSS, and JS.

Througout the creation of Totes, I've learned about many of the basic principles of the three langueages, as well as core concepts such as the DOM, JS modules, OOP, and how to use HTML5 canvas, and local storage. Totes is a notes app that is mimics a cork board. It comes with a variety of functions such as:

- import/export
- customizable notes using Quilljs text editor, color picker, and 
- optional canvas mode where users can drag and drop notes wherever they want

## Word Wizard

https://github.com/parrottjrs/Word-Generator#word-wizard

Word Wizard was my first project and my introduction to front-end development. 

It is a random word-generator that uses asynchronous functions to either pull from an array I created, or from an API. The word is given a random colour and font as well. For more randomness, I added a random quote function that pulls from an array upon loading the home page. 

Working on this project gave me a solid understanding of HTML elements, the relationship between HTML and CSS, how to create JS functions, event listeners, and basic array use. I was also briefly introduced to asynchronous functions and APIs while working on this one.

### Canvas Practice

https://github.com/parrottjrs/canvas-practice#canvas-practice

This was my intro to HTML5 canvas, and it was a ton of fun. By working on this, I learned about canvas context and how to draw on the canvas. I also learned about a few important concepts like OOP and event handling.

The main portion of this little project involved creating a function that draws out a preditermined number of circles that bounce, losing momentum and eventually staying on the bottom of the screen. I learned how to create forces such as gravity and friction as well as how to test for collisions between objects.

The second part was a test run for the canvas portion of Totes McNotes, where I created some squares and learned to handle mouse events on the canvas to drag the squares around.

### [Nameless RPG]

https://github.com/parrottjrs/nameless-rpg#nameless-rpg

There's not much to say about this one. I started working on this for nothing but fun and it turned into the canvas idea for Totes McNotes!

I haven't gotten very far, but I did learn some map theory, and how to use the Tiled map editor, which was a really cool experience!

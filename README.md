# Think-Write

Here's the [Think-Write repo](http://github.com/parrottjrs/think-write)
or
[Check out the app in all it's glory.](https://parrottjrs.github.io/think-write)

Think-Write is the project that launched me into the wonderful world of React and Typescript. During its creationn I also used Tailwind for the first time.

I learned many things from this project-- how to use state, reducers, useEffect, references, etc as well as how to manipulate .TSX files in an efficient and meaningful way. It provided me with hours of practice that bolstered my skills and confidence as a developer and solidified my understanding of many basic concepts that I learned in my previous projects. For now it uses local storage but in the future I plan on developing a back end for it.

Think-Write is a modern replacement for word processors that gives the creator some tools to help with accountability during the process. The main features are: 

### session lock

Writers can save their text in a "locked" state. Locked text is read-only and is locked until a predetermined date. Once the "lock date" has passed, the writer is free to edit it. 

### Pomodoro Timer

Think-Write's built in timer gives the writer the choice between one of two timer rotations. Each selection gives the writer a pre-designated work-period followed by a shorter break period. This works on 4 rotations so the writer doesn't have to worry about resetting it too often.

Think write is bit of a passion project that involves a some of my personal history. I won't get into that here but you can watch the video below for more info or refer to the [README]((https://github.com/parrottjrs/think-write#think-write)).

## Totes McNotes

Check out the repo [here](https://github.com/parrottjrs/totes-mcnotes#hi-my-name-is-jordan-and-welcome-to-totes-mcnotes) or [dive straight into the app](https://parrottjrs.github.io/totes-mcnotes/) 

Totes McNotes is my main project for the first module of my course, and my first _real_ stab at using HTML, CSS, and JS.

Througout the creation of Totes, I've learned about many of the basic principles of the three langueages, as well as core concepts such as the DOM, JS modules, OOP, and how to use HTML5 canvas, and local storage. Totes is a notes app that is mimics a cork board. It comes with a variety of functions such as:

- import/export
- customizable notes using Quilljs text editor, color picker, and 
- optional canvas mode where users can drag and drop notes wherever they want

## Word Wizard

https://github.com/parrottjrs/Word-Generator#word-wizard

Word Wizard was my first project and my introduction to front-end development. 

It is a random word-generator that uses asynchronous functions to either pull from an array I created, or from an API. The word is given a random colour and font as well. For more randomness, I added a random quote function that pulls from an array upon loading the home page. 

Working on this project gave me a solid understanding of HTML elements, the relationship between HTML and CSS, how to create JS functions, event listeners, and basic array use. I was also briefly introduced to asynchronous functions and APIs while working on this one.
